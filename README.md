# website_Preview_Creator
This is a Bash script that generates an HTML page containing a preview of a website, automatically redirecting the user to it. The user inputs the website URL, name, a brief description, and an associated image. An HTML preview file is then created, which can either be opened directly in a browser or saved for later use.

Legitimate Uses:

Website Testing: Create quick previews of specific websites for testing purposes.

Marketing and Advertising: Present interactive previews of products or services.

Education: Train beginners on basic HTML page creation techniques.


Suspicious Uses (Warning):

This script can be maliciously used in the following activities:

1. Phishing: Create fake pages that mimic legitimate websites to trick victims into entering their credentials.


2. Email Spam: Embed these pages in emails to redirect recipients to fraudulent websites.


3. Social Media Exploitation: Share shortened links that redirect users to malicious sites.
